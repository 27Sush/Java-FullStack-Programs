# Java Full Stack Projects

Welcome to my **Java Full Stack Projects** repository! These projects were developed during my Full Stack development course and showcase my skills across various Java technologies.

##  Repository Structure

| Directory | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Hibernate/** | Projects demonstrating ORM concepts with Hibernate. |
| **JDBC/Jdbc_Demo/** | Hands-on examples for database connectivity using JDBC and SQL operations. |
| **JavaServer Pages/JspDemo/** | JSP-based web pages for frontend and backend logic. |
| **Servlets/** | Sample servlet applications handling HTTP request/response. |
| **Spring Framework/** | Applications built using Spring core concepts, dependency injection, and possibly Spring Boot. |

##  Project Overview

Each project contains:
- A `src/` directory with the source code.
- A `pom.xml` (for Maven-managed projects) or setup files as needed.
- (If added) A local `README.md` inside each folder explaining how to build/run that project.

##  Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/27Sush/Java-FullStack-Programs.git
   cd Java-FullStack-Programs
2. Run a project
* Import the desired project into your IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ).
* Build and run using Maven:
  ```bash 
  mvn clean install
  # or use `mvn spring-boot:run` for Spring Boot applications
* Alternatively, use your IDE to run classes with a main() method or deploy servlets on a local server.

## Technologies Covered
* Core Java & JDBC ‚Äî Database CRUD, SQL connectivity

* ORM/Hibernate ‚Äî Entity mapping, session management

* Web ‚Äî JSP, servlets, HTTP handling

* Spring Framework ‚Äî Dependency injection, controllers, possibly REST APIs

## Next Steps & Improvements
* Add individual README.md files inside each project folder for specific build & usage instructions.

* (Optional) Convert each small app into a Spring Boot project for easier execution.

* Include sample input/output screenshots or screenshots of the UI (if applicable).

* Add .gitignore to filter out IDE-specific and build files (if not already added).
